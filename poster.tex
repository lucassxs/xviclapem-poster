\resumo{\newline 
In this poster is presented the package developed in R "WeatherMaringa", 
whose purpose is to collect data from the INMET(National Institute of Meteorology) or 
ECPM(Main Climatological Station of Maring치) databases of the city of Maring치 
in the State of Paran치 in Brazil through an API developed in R using 
the "Plumber" package, where the data are updated daily at 11:00 PM. 
In the operation of the package, the variables of the package 
perform through functions: descriptive analyses and other 
probabilistic statistical functions; and access to the INMET or ECPM database 
alternately.
